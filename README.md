# 📷 Interactive Image Gallery

A simple photo gallery built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**.  
This was one of my first JavaScript projects — made to practice **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **modal popups**.

## 🚀 Features

- Loads 100+ random images using [Picsum Photos](https://picsum.photos/)
- Clicking on an image opens a fullscreen **lightbox modal**
- Modal can be closed by clicking the ❌ or pressing `Escape`
- Clean, responsive layout with **CSS Grid**
- Simple hover effects for interactivity

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** for structure  
- **CSS3** for styling and layout  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** for all logic and interactivity  
- No frameworks or libraries used – built entirely from scratch

## 📚 What I Learned

- Creating and appending DOM elements dynamically
- Writing clean event listeners for clicks and keypresses
- Using modals and handling open/close states
- Building a responsive grid with minimal CSS

## 🧠 Notes

This project was built in my **first month of learning JavaScript**.  
It helped me understand how everything on the browser works — without relying on React or any library.
